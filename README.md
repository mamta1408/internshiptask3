## üîß Recommendations

- **Enforce SMB signing** and apply latest security patches to avoid MITM attacks.
- **Harden SSL/TLS configurations** by disabling weak protocols and using modern cipher suites.
- **Review all informational alerts** ‚Äî while not immediately dangerous, they help in attack surface mapping.
- **Restrict unnecessary open ports and services** based on port scanner results.
